## Introduction

**ATTENTION**: We're still in a very early alpha version, the API may and
*will* change frequently. Please, use it at your own risk, until we release
version 1.0 (Nov 2018).

**Cactoos JDBC** is a collection of object-oriented Java wrapper classes to
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity).

**Motivation**.
We are not happy with
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity)
because it is procedural and not object-oriented. It does its job, but mostly
through strongly coupled classes and static methods. Cactoos JDBC is suggesting
to do almost exactly the same, but through (more OO) objects.

Besides, [ORM is a
anti-pattern](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)
and should avoid with all cost. But we can use an library to help us to make
our data persistence. Thus, Cactoos JDBC will help us to do it too.

**Principles**.
These are the [design principles](http://www.elegantobjects.org#principles)
behind Cactoos JDBC.


## Features

- Select, Insert, Update and Delete data from a [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)

- Tests on PostgreSQL and MySQL RDBMS


## How to use

```xml

  <groupId>com.github.fabriciofx.cactoos-jdbc</groupId>
  <artifactId>cactoos-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Java version required: 1.8+.


## Agenda application (demo)

An agenda application has been developed to demonstrate and test the
catoos-jdbc API. To see it, please look [here](https://github.com/fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/fabriciofx/cactoos/jdbc/agenda).

## Usage
Let's show how use the API. For all above examples, let's start creating a
`Session` object:
```java
final Session session = new NoAuthSession(
    new H2Source("testdb")
);
```

### Update
Now, let's create a table using a `Update` command:
```java
new Update(
    session,
    new SimpleQuery(
        "CREATE TABLE employee (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, " +
        "name VARCHAR(50), salary DOUBLE)"
    )
).result()
```

### Insert
Let's insert a new employee and return the id of inserted employee.
```java
final int id = new ResultToValue<>(
    new InsertWithKeys(
        session,
        new KeyedQuery(
            "INSERT INTO employee (name, salary) VALUES (:name, :salary)",
            new TextValue("name", "Jeff Bridge"),
            new DoubleValue("salary", 12345.00)
        )
    ),
    Integer.class
).value();
```

### Select
Let's retrieve the name of a employee:
```java
final String name = new ResultToValue<>(
    new Select(
        session,
        new SimpleQuery(
            "SELECT name FROM employee WHERE id = :id",
            new IntValue("id", 123)
        )
    ),
    String.class
).value();
```

Let's retrieve all employee salaries:
```java
final List<Double> salaries = new ResultToValues<>(
    new Select(
        session,
        new SimpleQuery(
            "SELECT salary FROM employee"
        )
    ),
    Double.class
).value();
```

### Transaction

To enable a transaction you will need to do two things:
1. Decorates a `Session` object using a `TransactedSession` object, like here:
```java
final TransactedSession transacted = new TransactedSession(session);
```
2. Use a `Transaction` object to perform all transacted operations, like here:
```java
new Transaction(
  transacted,
  () -> {
    final Contact contact = new SqlContacts(transacted)
        .contact("Albert Einstein");
    contact.phones().phone("912232325", "TIM");
    contact.phones().phone("982231234", "Oi");
    return contact;
  }
).result();
```

To a complete example, please take a look [here](https://github.com/fabriciofx/cactoos-jdbc/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/fabriciofx/cactoos/jdbc/stmt/TransactionTest.java).


### Logging
To enable logging just decorate a `Session` object:
```java
final Session logging = new LoggingSession(session);
```


## How compile it?

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```
