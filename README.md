## Introduction

**ATTENTION**: We're still in a very early alpha version, the API may and
*will* change frequently. Please, use it at your own risk, until we release
version 1.0 (Nov 2018).

**Cactoos JDBC** is a collection of object-oriented Java wrapper classes to
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity).

**Motivation**.
We are not happy with
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity)
because it is procedural and not object-oriented. It does its job, but mostly
through strongly coupled classes and static methods. Cactoos JDBC is suggesting
to do almost exactly the same, but through (more OO) objects.

Besides, [ORM is a
anti-pattern](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/12/01/orm-offensive-anti-pattern.html)
and should avoid with all cost. But we can use an library to help us to make
our data persistence. Thus, Cactoos JDBC will help us to do it too.

**Principles**.
These are the [design principles](http://www.elegantobjects.org#principles)
behind Cactoos JDBC.


## Features

- Select, Insert, Update and Delete data from a [RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system)
- Named parameters statement
- Retrieve the data as XML
- Easy logging
- SQL Script execution
- Batch
- Transactions


## Feature to be implemented
- Retrieve the data as JSON
- Caching


## How to use

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.fabriciofx.cactoos-jdbc</groupId>
  <artifactId>cactoos-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Java version required: 1.8+.


## Usage
Let's show how use the API. For all above examples, let's start creating a
`Session` object:
```java
final Session session = new NoAuthSession(
    new H2Source("testdb")
);
```

### Update
Now, let's create a table using a `Update` command:
```java
new Update(
    session,
    new NamedQuery(
        "CREATE TABLE employee (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, " +
        "name VARCHAR(50), salary DOUBLE)"
    )
).result()
```

### Insert
Let's insert a new employee and return the id of inserted employee.
```java
final int id = new ResultToValue<>(
    new InsertWithKeys(
        session,
        new KeyedQuery(
            "INSERT INTO employee (name, salary) VALUES (:name, :salary)",
            new TextValue("name", "Jeff Bridge"),
            new DoubleValue("salary", 12345.00)
        )
    ),
    Integer.class
).value();
```

### Select
Let's retrieve the name of a employee:
```java
final String name = new ResultToValue<>(
    new Select(
        session,
        new NamedQuery(
            "SELECT name FROM employee WHERE id = :id",
            new IntValue("id", 123)
        )
    ),
    String.class
).value();
```

Let's retrieve all employee salaries:
```java
final List<Double> salaries = new ResultToValues<>(
    new Select(
        session,
        new NamedQuery(
            "SELECT salary FROM employee"
        )
    ),
    Double.class
).value();
```

### Transactions

`TransactedSession` is a class decorates a `Session` to support transactions.
`TransactedSession` generates an unique `TransactedConnection` which isn't auto
commited `Connection` and only closes when a `commmit()` or `rollback()` is
done. Hence, you can pass an instance of `TransactedSession` to all SQL objects
that can close a connection, but the connection won't be closed (until a
`commit()` or `rollback()`) which will be done into a `Transaction` class.
Let's make an example:

```java
final TransactedSession transacted = new TransactedSession(session);
new Transaction(
  transacted,
  () -> {
    final Contact einstein = new SqlContacts(transacted)
        .contact("Albert Einstein");
    einstein.phones().phone("912232325", "TIM");
    einstein.phones().phone("982231234", "Oi");
    return einstein;
  }
).result();
```

### Logging
To enable logging just decorate a `Session` object:
```java
final Session logging = new LoggingSession(session);
```


## How compile it?

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```
