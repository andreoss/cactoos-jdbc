## Introduction

**ATTENTION**: We're still in a very early alpha version, the API may and
*will* change frequently. Please, use it at your own risk, until we release
version 1.0 (Sep 2018).

**Cactoos JDBC** is a collection of object-oriented Java wrapper classes to
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity).

**Motivation**.
We are not happy with
[JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity)
because it is procedural and not object-oriented. It does its job, but mostly
through strongly coupled classes and static methods. Cactoos JDBC is suggesting
to do almost exactly the same, but through (more OO) objects.

**Principles**.
These are the [design principles](http://www.elegantobjects.org#principles)
behind Cactoos JDBC.


## How to use

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.fabriciofx.cactoos-jdbc</groupId>
  <artifactId>cactoos-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Java version required: 1.8+.

## Transactions

`TransactedSession` is a class decorates a `Session` to support transactions.
`TransactedSession` generates an unique `TransactedConnection`.
`TransactedConnection` is a not auto commited `Connection` that only closes
when a `commmit()` or `rollback()` is done. Hence, you can pass an instance of
`TransactedSession` to all SQL objects that can close a connection, but the
connection won't be closed (until a `commit()` or `rollback()`) which will be
done into a `Transaction` class. Let's make an example:

```java
final TransactedSession session = new TransactedSession(
    new NoAuthSession(
        new H2Source("testdb")
    )
);
new Transaction(
  session,
  () -> {
    final Contact einstein = new SqlContacts(session)
        .contact("Albert Einstein");
    einstein.phones().phone("912232325", "TIM");
    einstein.phones().phone("982231234", "Oi");
    return einstein;    
  }
).result();
```


## How compile it?

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```
