# Cactoos JDBC

**Cactoos JDBC** is a is a [*true object-oriented*](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html)
wrapper of [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity)
API.

## What does *true object-oriented* means?

This application follows these four fundamental principles:

  * No `null` ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html))
  * No code in constructors ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/05/07/ctors-must-be-code-free.html))
  * No getters and setters ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html))
  * No mutable objects ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html))
  * No `static` methods, not even `private` ones ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/02/07/private-method-is-new-class.html))
  * No `instanceof`, type casting, or reflection ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html))
  * No implementation inheritance ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/09/13/inheritance-is-procedural.html))
  * No public methods without `@Override`
  * No statements in test methods except `assertThat` ([why?](http://www.yegor256.com/2017/05/17/single-statement-unit-tests.html))
